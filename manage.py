manage.py for the Audionomy Django Project.

This script serves as the command-line utility for administrative tasks,
such as running the development server, applying database migrations, creating
a superuser, and collecting static files.

Usage:
    poetry run python manage.py runserver
    poetry run python manage.py migrate
    poetry run python manage.py createsuperuser
    ...

Environment:
    - By default, it sets DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE to 'audionomy_project.settings'.
    - For alternative configurations (e.g., production), set the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE
      environment variable accordingly before running the command.

Example:
    DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE="audionomy_project.settings_production" poetry run python manage.py runserver
